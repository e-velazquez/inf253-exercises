  <h1>Adaptogens</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my website about <strong>adaptogens</strong>! If you're wondering what an "<em>adaptogen</em>" is, this website
    give you a brief explanation. In addition, you will learn about the most common adaptogens found
    in our every day lives that do so much for our health and well being.
  </p>

  <p>
    According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, an adaptogen is defined as:
    "a nontoxic substance and especially a plant extract that is held to increase
    the body's ability to resist the damaging effects of stress and promote or
    restore normal physiological functioning". My fascination with adaptogens began three years ago when
    I started working at a tea shop. A year later, I took a Theology course at Dominican University with
    Fr.Richard Woods, O.P. where the course revolved around spirituality and healing. Father Woods
    discussed holistic healing and how we can take advantage of adaptogens due to their powerful healing
    abilities. He lent me his book on adaptogens and I have not stopped doing my research on them since.

  <h2>Common Adaptogens</h2>

  <p>Some of the most common adaptogens are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Peppermint</li>
      <li>Lavender</li>
      <li>Ginger</li>
      <li>Goji berry</li>
      <li>Chamomile</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    Adaptogens are great because they help us fight daily stressors. They can  easily be incorporated
    into our routines, as they can be consumed in different forms: raw, through teas, or in capsules.
    For the most part, there are very little side effects, as it is rare to overdose on adaptogens.
    They are also great because they are accessible and usually taste or smell great.
