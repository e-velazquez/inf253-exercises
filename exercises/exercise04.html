  <h1>Crystals and Stones</h1>
  <p>This website is all about the topic of crystals. Recently, I've gained a great interest
    in learning about crystals, as I've heard a lot about how powerful they can be when used
    appropriately.</p>

  <p> Most of us probably know a thing or two about what a crystal is from having taken a Geology or perhaps an Earth and Space
    science course in middle school or high school, but they are never taught in the way where their powers and abilities are explained.
    From what I have learned, crystals are able to store energy from their surroundings. When held, a person can essentially transfer
  their energy, whether good or bad to this crystal. Healing crystals and stones can be used for manifestations and intentions.

  The website <a href="https://www.energymuse.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-healing-crystals/">energymuse.com</a> states,
  <blockquote cite="https://www.energymuse.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-healing-crystals/">
    "Albert Einstein said everything in life is vibration, and just like sound waves,
     your thoughts match the vibrations of everything that manifests in your life.
    Therefore, if you think crystals have healing potential,
     the positive vibes of the stones will amplify those thoughts."
