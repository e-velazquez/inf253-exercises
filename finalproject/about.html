    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <h3>Astrology</h3>
    <p>I have been interested in the study of Astrology for most of my life, but especially in the past 3 years.
    <br>Thanks to the social media application, Twitter, I have been really invested in learning more about Astrology through tweets
    that have discussed something called a "natal chart". Learning what a natal chart was opened my interest in diving into
    my own birth chart and ultimately has allowed me to understand myself and others.
    <br>I am a Libra sun, Aquarius moon, and Pisces rising!
    </p>
    <h3>Tea</h3>
    <p>While I've been in college, I have worked full time at a loose leaf retail shop, where I have tried over 300 different loose tea blends.
      I began working at DavidsTea in late 2016, and while it is hard to believe it has been 3 years, I have gained a lot of knowledge on all things
      tea. Although I am not certified, I call myself a tea master, as I drink about 4-5 cups of different teas every day on average. The history,
      processing methods, preparation methods, and flavor profles of tea fascinate me.
    <h3>Crystals & Gemstones</h3>
    <p>This past year I have gained a great interest in crystals and their powerful abilities.
      Most people may not know that crystals are able to store energy from their surroundings, and when held, a person can essentially transfer
      their energy, whether good or bad to this crystal. Healing crystals and stones can be used for manifestations and intentions.
      My favorite crystals and stones are:
      <ol>
        <li>Clear Quartz</li>
        <li>Amethyst</li>
        <li>Black tourmaline</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
